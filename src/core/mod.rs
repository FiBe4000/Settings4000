//! GTK-free domain logic (architecture §2).
//!
//! Everything that can be reasoned about and tested without a display lives
//! here: the typed settings model and validators, the staging/dirty/conflict
//! state machine, installed-app detection, and the transactional apply
//! pipeline. Keeping this layer independent of the UI is what makes the core
//! behavior headlessly unit-testable (R6.2).
//!
//! Hard layering rule: this module and everything under it must never import
//! `gtk` or `relm4`. Side effects (running commands, writing files) are
//! reached only through the abstractions in [`crate::system`]. The rule is
//! enforced by `tests/module_boundaries.rs`; a violation fails the test suite.
